Week 1: Sample Data Collection & Organization
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Define project scope and data sources (Reliable sources of vast information)
  Objective: Finalize and specify project scope & goals (COMPLETED)
  Objective: Find 1-2 sources of information related (COMPLETED)
Collect & clean a small dataset (Only enough for testing)
  Objective: Decide on data format (CSV, JSON, etc.) (COMPLETED)
  Objective: Collect a small dataset using the discovered sources
Organize data formats and structure
  Objective: Remove duplicates
  Objective: Remove nulls
  Objective: Create 2-3 functionalities for cleaning up the data (COMPLETED)
  Objective: Keep format consistency
Set up tools 
  Objective: Choose tools to build the program (Git, IDE, etc.)

Summary

Week 2 - 3: Program Development
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Week 2: Set up architecture, basic backend functions
  Objective: Define the system architecture
  Objective: Create basic endpoints and data models
Week 3: Implement core logic; start testing
  Objective: Develop main logics (data ingestion, processing, storage)
  Objective: Implement basic algorithms & classes
  Objective: Create test scripts for checking the correct outputs
  Objective: Begin input testings for the built functions
  Objective: Add advanced features (e.g., filtering, sorting, search)
  Objective: Optimize program performance
  Objective: Refactor code for modularity and maintainability
  Objective: Improve error handling and edge case coverage

Summary

Week 4 - 5: User Interface Development
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Week 4: Design UI/UX, build front-end components
  Objective: Form a wireframe UI/UX (Tkinter, Javascript, Figma, etc.)
  Objective: Develop functionalities of interaction systems (Buttons, Boxes, Listing)
  Objective: Shape responsive and accessible design
  Objective Connect mock data for UI testing
Week 5: Connect to backend, UI testing, other possible developments
  Objective: Connect frontend → backend (Usage, state management, debugging)
  Objective: Handle loading/error states dynamically
  Objective: Test, Polish features, and Fix bugs
Summary
Working frontend connected to live backend
Fully testable user interface
Final documentation for the program

Week 6 - 8: Big Data Collection
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Week 6 & 7: Scale data pipeline, collect large dataset
  Objective: Expand data collection (automation, scheduling, batch processing) ***IMPORTANT***
  Objective: Implement storage solution for large datasets (firebase, cloud DB, etc.)
Week 8:  Clean, validate, and integrate big data into the system
  Objective: Finish up monitoring data flow
  Objective: Merge with existing system
  Objective: Run tests with large data volume (for backend only)
Summary
Scalable data pipeline
Full dataset integrated with backend
Logs and quality control scripts

Miscellaneous: Plan
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
After finishing every prioritized tasks (e.g., toefl, math), finish at least 1-2 objectives a day 
despite the time of completion. However, this rule does not apply to the ***IMPORTANT***
objectives, which are expected to take longer than a day to complete.
